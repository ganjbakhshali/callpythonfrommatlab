s# callpythonfrommatlab
this is simple code that we call python function in matlab scripts


In this simple code, I call PGMpy factor product to product 2 factor and recieve result in matlab.

Result picture saved in directory.
If you make any change in your python file, you should call reloader.m in matlab first, then call factorMUL.py  .
